# Swift Presentation of Project on
# Stock Exchange Visualizations in Python

In this project, I will focus on interactive stock quote visualizations in Python. Data have been extracted from Yahoo! Finance . They relate to the stocks of eight financial institutions over 2001. 

There are two files in this repository:
* README.md,
* SE.html.

To open SE.html, you just need to activate https://dev-p-l.github.io/Stock_Exchange_Visualizations_in_Python/SE.html.
